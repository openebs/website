This article belongs to **#HowDoI** series on [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) and [**OpenEBS**](https://openebs.io/).

> Note: The approach mentioned in this article applies for OpenEBS version 6.0 or below. One can refer to this [link](https://github.com/openebs/community/pull/20) for OpenEBS version 0.8.0 and above.

A OpenEBS Volume comprises of a Target pod and Replica pod(s). There can be one or more Replica pods. The Replica pods are the ones that access the underlying disk resources for storing the data.

> **Use Case #1: **In my Kubernetes Cluster, I have certain nodes that have disks attached. I call these as Storage Nodes. I want the OpenEBS Volume Replica Pods to be scheduled on these Storage Nodes.

> **_Solution:_** Use Kubernetes “taints & tolerations” feature.

As per Kubernetes docs, taints allow a node to repel a set of pods. Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes.

- You can apply `*NoSchedule*` & `*NoExecute*` taints to the node(s).
- `*NoSchedule*` marks that the node should not schedule any pods that do not tolerate the taint.
- `*NoExecute*` marks that the node should evict existing/running pods that do not tolerate this taint.
- Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow the pods to get scheduled onto nodes with matching taints.
- You need to set an ENV variable in maya API server Deployment specifications, which in turn ensures setting of above tolerations on the replica pods.
- The ENV variable referred to here is `*DEFAULT_REPLICA_NODE_TAINT_TOLERATION*`

Following are the instructions to do the same:

    # Step 1  —  Taint the node(s)
    ```bash
    # kubeminion-01 is the name of a Kubernetes node
    # The taint effects used here are `NoSchedule` and `NoExecute`
    kubectl taint nodes kubeminion-01 storage=ssd:NoSchedule storage=ssd:NoExecute
    ```

    # Step 2  —  Maya API server should be deployed with below specs
    # This ensures the replica pods are set with appropriate tolerations
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
     name: maya-apiserver
    spec:
     replicas: 1
     template:
      metadata:
       labels:
        name: maya-apiserver
     spec:
       serviceAccountName: openebs-maya-operator
       containers:
       —  name: maya-apiserver
         imagePullPolicy: Always
         image: openebs/m-apiserver:0.5.3
         ports:
         —  containerPort: 5656
         env:
         —  name: DEFAULT_REPLICA_NODE_TAINT_TOLERATION
           value: storage=ssd:NoSchedule,storage=ssd:NoExecute
    ```

> **Use Case #2:** In my Kubernetes Cluster, I have certain nodes that have disks attached. I call these as Storage Nodes. I want the OpenEBS Volume Replica Pods to be scheduled on these Storage Nodes. In addition, I want a better utilisation of these nodes by being able to schedule my application Pods on these nodes as well.

> **Solution:** Use Kubernetes taints & tolerations feature. You may also want to try with `nodeAffinity` to achieve this. However, this solution focuses on use of tolerations.

- You need to make use of `*PreferNoSchedule*` as the taint effect.
- This can be thought of as a _soft version_ of `*NoSchedule*`.
- In other words the system tries to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not mandatory.

Following are the instructions to do the same:

    # Step 1  —  Taint the node(s)
    ```bash
    # kubeminion-01 is the name of a Kubernetes node
    # The taint effect used here is `PreferNoSchedule` i.e. a soft version of `NoSchedule` 
    # the system tries to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node,
    # but it is not mandatory.
    kubectl taint nodes kubeminion-01 storage=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
    ```

    # Step 2  —  Maya API server should be deployed with below specs
    # This ensures the replica pods are set with appropriate tolerations
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
     name: maya-apiserver
     namespace: default
    spec:
     replicas: 1
     template:
      metadata:
       labels:
        name: maya-apiserver
      spec:
       serviceAccountName: openebs-maya-operator
       containers:
       —  name: maya-apiserver
         imagePullPolicy: Always
         image: openebs/m-apiserver:0.5.3
         ports:
         —  containerPort: 5656
         env:
         — name: DEFAULT_REPLICA_NODE_TAINT_TOLERATION
           value: storage=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
     ```

If you want to learn more on taints & tolerations, then go through [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)

I shall strive to put more such articles in future. Do let me know if you want any specific topics that I should explain.
