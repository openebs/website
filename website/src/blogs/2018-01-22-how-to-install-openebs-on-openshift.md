## What is OpenShift Origin?

**OpenShift Origin** is the upstream community project used in all deployment models provided by Red Hat OpenShift such as **OpenShift Online**, **OpenShift Dedicated**, and **OpenShift Container Platform**. **Red Hat OpenShift** is an enterprise container application platform that is based on a core of **Docker **container packaging, **Kubernetes **container cluster management and the **OpenShift Origin** project itself.

First, having more than one option sounds confusing, but they clearly differentiate from each other. Here is the summary of all available deployment models to start with OpenShift.

- [**OpenShift Origin**](https://www.openshift.org/) is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment. Origin is open source and all source code for the Origin project is available under the Apache License v2.0 on GitHub. Website and documentation for the Origin project are under [www.openshift.org](https://www.openshift.org/). It is completely free, you can deploy Origin on baremetal, in a VM or on a cloud. This is the option I will focus on this article.
- [**OpenShift Online**](https://manage.openshift.com/) is Red Hat’s public cloud application development and hosting service. Starter plan is free to use and includes 1 project, 1GiB memory, 1GiB terminating memory and 1GiB storage. Pro Plan costs $50/month and includes 10 projects, 2GiB memory, 2GiB terminating memory and 2GiB storage. Details are available [here](https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html).
- [**OpenShift Dedicated**](https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/index.html) is Red Hat’s managed private cluster offering, built around a core of application containers powered by Docker, with orchestration and management provided by Kubernetes, on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It’s available on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) marketplaces. A complete OpenShift 3 cluster, configured for high availability (HA) with a minimum of 5 masters, infrastructure nodes and 4 application nodes managed by Red Hat costs $48k. Details are available [here](https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/index.html#pricing).
- [**OpenShift Container Platform**](https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html) (formerly OpenShift Enterprise) is Red Hat’s on-premise private PaaS product.

In this blog post, I will focus on configuring **OpenEBS** as a **persistent storage** option on the open-source self-managed **OpenShift Origin** and deploy a stateful workload both from CLI and custom catalog template using OpenEBS storage classes.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- Minimum two nodes. Recommended four or more (Baremetal, VMs or cloud instances)

### Software components used

- [CentOS 7.x](https://www.centos.org/download/)
- [OpenShift Origin 3.7+](https://github.com/openshift/origin)
- [OpenShift-Ansible](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible) (master branch used for installation)
- [OpenEBS 0.5.1](https://openebs.io/)

**Note: **Make sure the following package dependencies are installed: python, wget, git, net-tools, bind-utils, iptables-services, bridge-utils, bash-completion, kexec-tools, sos, psacct, docker-1.12.6, ansible, pyOpenSS, httpd-tool

### Install OpenShift Origin

Follow instructions from [OpenShift Origin Latest Documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html) to deploy a multi-node Origin cluster. If you are deploying it for the first time it may be a bit complicated. I plan to post my notes, steps on getting minimum requirements satisfied and have a successful deployment after this post.

### Verify OpenShift Origin deployment

Execute the following commands to verify successful installation.

    # oc get nodes

Number of nodes you see maybe different in your case, but status should looks similar to below showing nodes ready.

    # oc get nodes
     NAME STATUS AGE VERSION
     oonode1 Ready 2d v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62
     oonode2 Ready 2d v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62
     oonode3 Ready 2d v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62
     oonode4 Ready 2d v1.7.6+a08f5eeb62

### Configure access permissions

Create a new admin user with cluster-admin role/permissions and assing password using the following commands:

    # oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin admin — as=system:admin
    # htpasswd /etc/origin/master/htpasswd admin

Login as the `admin` user and you will be using default project.

    # oc login -u admin

Output:

    # oc login -u admin
     Authentication required for https://oonode1:8443 (openshift)
     Username: admin
     Password:
     Login successful.
    You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with ‘oc project <projectname>’:
    * default
     kube-public
     kube-service-catalog
     kube-system
     logging
     management-infra
     openshift
     openshift-ansible-service-broker
     openshift-infra
     openshift-node
     openshift-template-service-broker
     openshift-web-console
    Using project “default”.

Provide access to the host volumes which is needed by the OpenEBS volume replicas by updating the default security context (scc). If you miss this step your replicas will fail to deploy.

    # oc edit scc restricted

Now set `allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true` and save changes. The file should look like below:

    # Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a ‘#’ will be ignored,
     # and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving this file will be
     # reopened with the relevant failures.
     #
     allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
     allowHostIPC: false
     allowHostNetwork: false
     allowHostPID: false
     allowHostPorts: false
     allowPrivilegedContainer: false
     allowedCapabilities: []
     allowedFlexVolumes: []
     apiVersion: v1
     defaultAddCapabilities: []
     fsGroup:
     type: MustRunAs
     groups:
     — system:authenticated
     kind: SecurityContextConstraints
     metadata:
     annotations:
     kubernetes.io/description: restricted denies access to all host features and requires
     pods to be run with a UID, and SELinux context that are allocated to the namespace. This
     is the most restrictive SCC and it is used by default for authenticated users.
     creationTimestamp: 2018–01–20T19:39:18Z
     name: restricted
     resourceVersion: “68274”
     selfLink: /api/v1/securitycontextconstraints/restricted
     uid: 9abddec5-fe19–11e7–8d06–005056873c08
     priority: null
     readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
     requiredDropCapabilities:
     — KILL

     — SETUID
     — SETGID
     runAsUser:
     type: MustRunAsRange
     seLinuxContext:
     type: MustRunAs
     supplementalGroups:
     type: RunAsAny
     users: []
     volumes:
     — configMap
     — downwardAPI
     — emptyDir
     — hostPath
     — persistentVolumeClaim
     — projected
     — secret

Save changes.

### Install OpenEBS on Origin

There are few easy ways to install OpenEBS. You can either apply the operator and storageclasses direct from the URL or clone the repo and execute from the local copy. I prefer to clone a local copy, but i’ll also give you the other option if you prefer.

Clone the latest OpenEBS files and sample application specs using the below command on your OpenShift master node:

    # git clone https://github.com/openebs/openebs.git
     # cd openebs/k8s

Apply the file two yaml files below:

    # oc apply -f openebs-operator.yaml
    # oc apply -f openebs-storageclasses.yaml

Alternative way — If you choose not to copy from the repo you can apply the yaml file direct from the URL below:

    oc apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml

### Verify OpenEBS deployment

Verify that the OpenEBS provisioner and API server are created successfully and running.

    # oc get deployments
     NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
     maya-apiserver 1 1 1 1 2d
     openebs-provisioner 1 1 1 1 2d

Check pods to confirm maya-apiserver and openebs-provisioner.

    # oc get pods
     NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
     docker-registry-1-b5r7t 1/1 Running 0 2d
     maya-apiserver-3053842955-xbx8w 1/1 Running 0 2d
     openebs-provisioner-2499455298–46brm 1/1 Running 0 2d
     registry-console-1-mrpc9 1/1 Running 0 2d
     router-1-bf775 1/1 Running 3 2d

Check services to confirm maya-apiserver exists.

    # oc get service
     NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE
     docker-registry 172.30.113.229 <none> 5000/TCP 2d
     kubernetes 172.30.0.1 <none> 443/TCP,53/UDP,53/TCP 2d
     maya-apiserver-service 172.30.17.113 <none> 5656/TCP 2d
     registry-console 172.30.148.98 <none> 9000/TCP 2d
     router 172.30.229.239 <none> 80/TCP,443/TCP,1936/TCP 2d

Check service accounts for openebs-maya-operator:

    # oc get sa
     NAME SECRETS AGE
     builder 2 2d
     default 3 2d
     deployer 2 2d
     openebs-maya-operator 2 2d
     registry 3 2d
     router 2 2d
    # oc get clusterrole openebs-maya-operator
     \NAME
     openebs-maya-operator
    # oc get clusterrolebindings openebs-maya-operator
     NAME ROLE USERS GROUPS SERVICE ACCOUNTS SUBJECTS
     openebs-maya-operator /openebs-maya-operator default/openebs-maya-operator, default/default

And finally verify OpenEBS default storage classes.

    # oc get sc
     NAME TYPE
     openebs-cassandra openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-es-data-sc openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-jupyter openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-kafka openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-mongodb openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-percona openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-redis openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-standalone openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-standard openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi
     openebs-zk openebs.io/provisioner-iscsi

After few easy steps we are now ready to deploy workloads on persistent storage provided by OpenEBS. I’ll cover both CLI and Catalog installation through the OpenShift Web Console.

### Install Percona on OpenEBS using OC CLI

Use OpenEBS as persistent storage for a Percona DB deployment by selecting the `openebs-percona` storage class in the persistent volume claim. I will use the sample file available in the openebs repo which I cloned locally in the previous steps.

View the Percona deployment yaml:

    # cd openebs/k8s/demo/percona
    # cat demo-percona-mysql-pvc.yaml
     — -
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
     name: percona
     labels:
     name: percona
     spec:
     containers:
     — resources:
     limits:
     cpu: 0.5
     name: percona
     image: percona
     args:
     — “ — ignore-db-dir”
     — “lost+found”
     env:
     — name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
     value: k8sDem0
     ports:
     — containerPort: 3306
     name: percona
     volumeMounts:
     — mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
     name: demo-vol1
     volumes:
     — name: demo-vol1
     persistentVolumeClaim:
     claimName: demo-vol1-claim
     — -
     kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
     apiVersion: v1
     metadata:
     name: demo-vol1-claim
     spec:
     storageClassName: openebs-percona
     accessModes:
     — ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
     requests:
     storage: 5G

As you can see in the yaml file above, `storageClassName` is set to `openebs-percona` which has 2 replicas.

Now, apply the file:

    # oc apply -f demo-percona-mysql-pvc.yaml

Finally, verify that Percona is deployed and OpenEBS controller and replica are running:

    # oc get pods
     NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
     docker-registry-1-b5r7t 1/1 Running 0 2d
     maya-apiserver-3053842955-xbx8w 1/1 Running 0 2d
     openebs-provisioner-2499455298–46brm 1/1 Running 0 2d
     percona-1378140207–5q2gb 1/1 Running 0 15mh
     pvc-c7a24dc8-ffc7–11e7-a7cd-005056873c08-ctrl-1719480235-xf4t5 2/2 Running 0 15m
     pvc-c7a24dc8-ffc7–11e7-a7cd-005056873c08-rep-1550141838-ldm59 1/1 Running 0 15m

### Install MongoDB on OpenEBS using the OpenShift Web Console
