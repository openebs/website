### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard for the OpenEBS project. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/HEAD/contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin).

Please certify it by just adding a line to every git commit message. Any PR with Commits which does not have DCO Signoff will not be accepted:

```
  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

or use the command `git commit -s -m "commit message comes here"` to sign-off on your commits.

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with `git ci` and the commit will be signed.
