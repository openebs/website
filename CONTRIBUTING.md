# Contributing to OpenEBS Website

## Sign your commits

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard for the OpenEBS projects. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure that contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license. Please read [dcofile](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/master/contribute/developer-certificate-of-origin). If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:
