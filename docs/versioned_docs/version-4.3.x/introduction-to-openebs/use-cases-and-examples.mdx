OpenEBS is a fully open source storage stack used for easily and effectively running stateful applications on Kubernetes.

Following are a few examples of how OpenEBS is being used:

- [Self Managed Database Service like RDS](#self-managed-database-service-like-rds)
- [Open source durable storage for Observability stack](#open-source-durable-storage-for-observability-stack)
- [Running CI/CD on Kubernetes](#running-ci-cd-on-kubernetes)
- [Self managed Object storage service](#self-managed-object-storage-service)
- [Building scalable websites and ML pipelines](#building-scalable-websites-and-ml-pipelines)

### Self Managed Database Service like RDS

As per the [CNCF Database Technology Radar report](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-11-database-storage), many companies working with sensitive data are more likely to host databases in-house and may even be required to. Also, if a company has a large amount of data, for instance, there can be significant cost overhead to using a managed database solution available from cloud providers. Additionally, the data mesh pattern is leading to a proliferation of small self managed DBs.  

OpenEBS through its simplicity in set up and configuration and built on the resilience of Kubernetes orchestration can be used to easily set up a managed database service. Using OpenEBS you get the benefits of:

- Fast local storage for cloud native databases
- Synchronously replicated storage for protecting against node or AZ failures if needed
- Enterprise storage features like Thin Provisioning, Storage Expansion, Data Protection, and more.

    {

### Open Source Durable Storage for Observability Stack

Open standards such as OpenMetrics and OpenTelemetry and open source tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Elastic have become widely adopted projects to run the [Cloud Native Observability Stack](https://radar.cncf.io/2020-09-observability). It should not come as any surprise that OpenEBS, being a prominent cloud native open source technology, is often the choice for running these open source observability stacks.

Examples:

<ImgCard
  dataList={[
    {
      Svg: "/docs/img/logos/prometheus.svg",
      title: "Prometheus",
      url: "",
    },
    {
      Svg: "/docs/img/logos/elasticsearch.svg",
      title: "elasticsearch",
      url: "",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Running CI/CD on Kubernetes

Jenkins, Gitlab, Gerrit, Sonarqube, and many of the tools built in-house are moving towards Kubernetes for better DevOps experience and agility. With Kubernetes becoming a standard to run the applications, the CI/CD tools that manage them are following suite, with many providers now providing Kubernetes Operators.

Examples:

<ImgCard
  dataList={[
    {
      Svg: "/docs/img/logos/gitlab.svg",
      title: "GitLab",
      url: "",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Self-managed Object Storage Service

Use OpenEBS and MinIO on Kubernetes to build cross AZ cloud native object storage solution. Kubernetes PVCs are used by MinIO to seamlessly scale MinIO nodes. OpenEBS provides easily scalable and manageable storage pools including Local Storage. The scalability of MinIO is directly complimented by OpenEBS's feature of cloud-native scalable architecture.

Examples:

<ImgCard
  dataList={[
    {
      Svg: "/docs/img/logos/minio.svg",
      title: "MinIO",
      url: "",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Building Scalable Websites and ML Pipelines

Many applications such as WordPress require shared storage with RWM access mode as do many ML pipelines. OpenEBS acting as a persistent storage backend for NFS solves this need very well.

Examples:

<ImgCard
  dataList={[
    {
      Svg: "/docs/img/logos/a-nfs.svg",
      title: "RWM",
      url: "",
    },
  ]}
/>
