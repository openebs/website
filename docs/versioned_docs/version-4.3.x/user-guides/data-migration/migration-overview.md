# Migration Overview

Data migration is the process of moving data from a source storage to a destination storage. In OpenEBS context, the users can migrate the data from legacy OpenEBS storage to the latest OpenEBS storage.

There are different techniques/methodologies for performing data migration. Users can perform data migration within the same Kubernetes cluster or across Kubernetes clusters. The following guides outline several methodologies for migrating from legacy OpenEBS storage to latest OpenEBS storage:
- [Migration using pv-migrate](migration-using-pv-migrate.md)
- [Migration using Velero](migration-using-velero/overview.md)

:::info
Users of non-OpenEBS storage solutions can also use these approaches described below to migrate their data to OpenEBS storage.
