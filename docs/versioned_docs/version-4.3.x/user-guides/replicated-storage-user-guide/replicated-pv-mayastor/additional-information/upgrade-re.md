## Upgrading Replicated PV Mayastor

Replicated PV Mayastor supports seamless upgrades starting with target version 2.1.0 and later, and source versions 2.0.0 and later. To upgrade from a previous version (1.0.5 or prior) to 2.1.0 or later, visit [Legacy Upgrade Support](legacy-upgrade.md). 

### Supported Upgrade Paths

- From 2.0.x to 2.6.1

:::info
- The upgrade operation utilises the [Kubectl Plugin](../advanced-operations/kubectl-plugin.md).
- The upgrade process is generally non-disruptive for volumes with a replication factor greater than one and all replicas being healthy, prior to starting the upgrade.

:::info
1. The time taken to upgrade is directly proportional to the number of IO engine nodes and storage volumes.
2. To upgrade to a particular Replicated PV Mayastor version, ensure you are using the same version of kubectl plugin.
3. The above process of upgrade creates one Job in the namespace where Replicated PV Mayastor is installed, one ClusterRole, one ClusterRoleBinding and one ServiceAccount.
