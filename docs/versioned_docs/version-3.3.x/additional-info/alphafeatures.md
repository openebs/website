## CSI Driver for Local PV - Device

OpenEBS is developing a CSI driver for provisioning Local PVs that are backed by block devices. 

For additional details and detailed instructions on how to get started with OpenEBS Local PV - Device CSI Driver please refer this [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/openebs/device-localpv).


## Dynamic NFS Provisioner

OpenEBS is developing a dynamic NFS PV provisioner that can setup a new NFS server on top of any block storage. 

For additional details and detailed instructions on how to get started with OpenEBS NFS PV provisioner please refer this [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-nfs-provisioner).

## OpenEBS CLI

OpenEBS is developing a kubectl plugin for openebs called `openebsctl` that can help perform administrative tasks on OpenEBS volumes and pools. 

For additional details and detailed instructions on how to get started with OpenEBS CLI please refer this [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/openebs/openebsctl).

## OpenEBS Monitoring Add-on

OpenEBS is developing a monitoring add-on package that can be installed via helm or kubectl for setting up a default prometheus, grafana and alert manager stack. The package also will include default service monitors, dashboards and alert rules. 

For additional details and detailed instructions on how to get started with OpenEBS Monitoring Add-on please refer this [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/openebs/monitoring).

## Data Populator

The Data populator can be used to load seed data into a Kubernetes persistent volume from another such volume. The data populator internally uses Rsync, which is a volume populator having the ability to create a volume from any rsync source. 

### Use cases

1. <b>Decommissioning of a node in the cluster</b>: In scenarios where a Kubernetes node needs to be decommissioned whether for upgrade or maintenance, a data populator can be used to migrate the data saved in the local storage of the node, that has to be decommissioned. 
2. <b>Loading seed data to Kubernetes volumes</b>: Data populator can be used to scale applications without using read-write many operation. The application can be pre-populated with the static content available in an existing PV.
