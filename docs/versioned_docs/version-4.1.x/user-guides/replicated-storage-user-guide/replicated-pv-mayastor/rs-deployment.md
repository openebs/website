# Deploy an Application

If all verification steps in the preceding stages were satisfied, then Replicated PV Mayastor has been successfully deployed within the cluster. In order to verify basic functionality, we will now dynamically provision a Persistent Volume based on a Replicated PV Mayastor StorageClass, mount that volume within a small test pod which we'll create, and use the [**Flexible I/O Tester**](https://github.com/axboe/fio) utility within that pod to check that I/O to the volume is processed correctly.

## Define the PVC

Use `kubectl` to create a PVC based on a StorageClass that you created in the [previous stage](../replicated-pv-mayastor/rs-configuration.md#create-replicated-storageclasss). In the example shown below, we will consider that StorageClass to have been named "mayastor-1". Replace the value of the field "storageClassName" with the name of your own Replicated PV Mayastor-based StorageClass.

For the purposes of this quickstart guide, it is suggested to name the PVC "ms-volume-claim", as this is what will be illustrated in the example steps which follow.

**Command**

```
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ms-volume-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: mayastor-1
EOF
```

**YAML**

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ms-volume-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: INSERT_YOUR_STORAGECLASS_NAME_HERE
```

If you used the storage class example from previous stage, then volume binding mode is set to `WaitForFirstConsumer`. That means, that the volume won't be created until there is an application using the volume. We will go ahead and create the application pod and then check all resources that should have been created as part of that in kubernetes.

## Deploy the FIO Test Pod

The Replicated PV Mayastor CSI driver will cause the application pod and the corresponding Replicated PV Mayastor volume's NVMe target/controller ("Nexus") to be scheduled on the same Replicated PV Mayastor Node, in order to assist with restoration of volume and application availabilty in the event of a storage node failure.

<!-- Fixme: :::warning
In this version, applications using PVs provisioned by Replicated PV Mayastor can only be successfully scheduled on Replicated PV Mayastor Nodes. This behaviour is controlled by the `local:` parameter of the corresponding StorageClass, which by default is set to a value of `true`. Therefore, this is the only supported value for this release - setting a non-local configuration may cause scheduling of the application pod to fail, as the PV cannot be mounted to a worker node other than a MSN. This behaviour will change in a future release.
::: -->

<!-- Fixme: Fix the YAML -->

**Command \(GitHub Latest\)**

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/mayastor/v1.0.9/deploy/fio.yaml
```

**YAML**

```
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: fio
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    openebs.io/engine: mayastor
  volumes:
    - name: ms-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: ms-volume-claim
  containers:
    - name: fio
      image: nixery.dev/shell/fio
      args:
        - sleep
        - "1000000"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/volume"
          name: ms-volume
```

## Verify the Volume and the Deployment

We will now verify the Volume Claim and that the corresponding Volume and Replicated PV Mayastor Volume resources have been created and are healthy.

### Verify the Volume Claim

The status of the PVC should be "Bound".

**Command**

```
kubectl get pvc ms-volume-claim
```

**Example Output**

```
NAME                STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS     AGE
ms-volume-claim     Bound    pvc-fe1a5a16-ef70-4775-9eac-2f9c67b3cd5b   1Gi        RWO            mayastor-1       15s
```

### Verify the Persistent Volume

:::info
Substitute the example volume name with that shown under the "VOLUME" heading of the output returned by the preceding "get pvc" command, as executed in your own cluster.
:::

**Command**

```
kubectl get pv pvc-fe1a5a16-ef70-4775-9eac-2f9c67b3cd5b
```

**Example Output**

```
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS   CLAIM                       STORAGECLASS     REASON   AGE
pvc-fe1a5a16-ef70-4775-9eac-2f9c67b3cd5b   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound    default/ms-volume-claim     mayastor-1       16m
```

### Verify the Replicated PV Mayastor Volume 

The status of the volume should be "online".

:::info
To verify the status of volume [Kubectl plugin](../replicated-pv-mayastor/advanced-operations/kubectl-plugin.md) is used.
:::

**Command**

```
kubectl mayastor get volumes
```

**Example Output**

```
ID                                    REPLICAS  TARGET-NODE                ACCESSIBILITY STATUS  SIZE

18e30e83-b106-4e0d-9fb6-2b04e761e18a  3         aks-agentpool-12194210-0   nvmf           Online  1073741824 
```

### Verify the Application

Verify that the pod has been deployed successfully, having the status "Running". It may take a few seconds after creating the pod before it reaches that status, proceeding via the "ContainerCreating" state.

:::info
Note: The example FIO pod resource declaration included with this release references a PVC named `ms-volume-claim`, consistent with the example PVC created in this section of the quickstart. If you have elected to name your PVC differently, deploy the Pod using the example YAML, modifying the `claimName` field appropriately.
:::

**Command**

```
kubectl get pod fio
```

**Example Output**

```
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fio    1/1     Running   0          34s
```

## Run the FIO Tester Application

We now execute the FIO Test utility against the Replicated PV Mayastor for 60 seconds, checking that I/O is handled as expected and without errors. In this quickstart example, we use a pattern of random reads and writes, with a block size of 4k and a queue depth of 16.

**Command**

```
kubectl exec -it fio -- fio --name=benchtest --size=800m --filename=/volume/test --direct=1 --rw=randrw --ioengine=libaio --bs=4k --iodepth=16 --numjobs=8 --time_based --runtime=60
```

**Example Output**

If no errors are reported in the output then PV has been correctly configured and is operating as expected.
