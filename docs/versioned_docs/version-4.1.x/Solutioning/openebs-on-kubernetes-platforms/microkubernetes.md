# Replicated PV Mayastor Installation on MicroK8s

## Prerequisites

Prepare a cluster by following the steps outlined in this [guide](../../user-guides/replicated-storage-user-guide/replicated-pv-mayastor/rs-installation.md#preparing-the-cluster).

## Install Replicated PV Mayastor on MicroK8s

To install Replicated PV Mayastor using Helm on MicroK8s, execute the following command:

**Command**

```
helm install openebs openebs/openebs -n openebs --create-namespace \ 
  --set mayastor.csi.node.kubeletDir="/var/snap/microk8s/common/var/lib/kubelet" \
  --set lvm-localpv.lvmNode.kubeletDir="/var/snap/microk8s/common/var/lib/kubelet" \
  --set zfs-localpv.zfsNode.kubeletDir="/var/snap/microk8s/common/var/lib/kubelet"
```

**Output**

```
NAME: openebs
LAST DEPLOYED: Wed Apr 17 14:35:22 2024
NAMESPACE: openebs
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
Successfully installed OpenEBS.

Check the status by running: kubectl get pods -n openebs

The default values will install both Local PV and Replicated PV. However,
the Replicated PV will require additional configuration to be fuctional.
The Local PV offers non-replicated local storage using 3 different storage
backends i.e HostPath, LVM and ZFS, while the Replicated PV provides one replicated highly-available
storage backend i.e Mayastor.
