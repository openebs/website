## Mayastor Overview 

**Mayastor** is a progressive sub-project of the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) Open Source initiative [**OpenEBS**](https://openebs.io/). OpenEBS is a "Container Attached Storage" (CAS) solution that extends Kubernetes by providing a declarative data plane, offering resilient and adaptable storage for stateful applications.

## Mayastor Design Goals

The fundamental design objectives driving Mayastor's development are as follows:

- **High Availability and Durability**: Mayastor aims to ensure the persistence of data with high levels of availability and durability, contributing to the reliability of applications in a Kubernetes environment.
- **Simplified Deployment and Management**: The project endeavors to achieve seamless deployment and effortless management, empowering autonomous SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) or development teams to handle the storage infrastructure efficiently.
- **Low Overhead Abstraction**: Mayastor is designed to be a lightweight abstraction, minimizing resource overhead while delivering optimal storage performance for workloads.

## NVMe-oF Semantics and Performance

Mayastor is built on the foundation of Intel's cutting-edge [Storage Performance Development Kit (SPDK)](https://spdk.io/). The project fully leverages the protocol and computational efficiency of NVMe-oF (Non-Volatile Memory Express over Fabrics) semantics. This approach harnesses the immense performance capabilities of the latest generation solid-state storage devices, delivering a storage abstraction that incurs performance overhead within single-digit percentages.

In contrast, traditional pre-CAS shared storage systems are known to introduce overhead, often exceeding 40% and occasionally reaching as high as 80% of the underlying device or cloud volume capabilities. Moreover, pre-CAS shared storage can scale unpredictably as various workloads compete for access to shared storage resources.

Although Mayastor utilizes NVMe-oF, it doesn't impose any requirements for the use of NVMe devices or cloud volumes.
