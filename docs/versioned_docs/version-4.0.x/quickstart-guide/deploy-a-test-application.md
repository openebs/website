# Deploy an Application

This section will help you to deploy an application.

## Create a PersistentVolumeClaim

The next step is to create a PersistentVolumeClaim. Pods will use PersistentVolumeClaims to request Hostpath Local PV from the *OpenEBS Dynamic Local PV provisioner*.

1. Here is the configuration file for the PersistentVolumeClaim. Save the following PersistentVolumeClaim definition as `local-hostpath-pvc.yaml`

   ```
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: local-hostpath-pvc
   spec:
     storageClassName: openebs-hostpath
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     resources:
       requests:
         storage: 5G
   ```

2. Create the PersistentVolumeClaim

   ```
   kubectl apply -f local-hostpath-pvc.yaml
   ```

3. Look at the PersistentVolumeClaim:
   
   ```
   kubectl get pvc local-hostpath-pvc
   ```

   The output shows that the `STATUS` is `Pending`. This means PVC has not yet been used by an application pod. The next step is to create a Pod that uses your PersistentVolumeClaim as a volume.

   ```shell hideCopy
   NAME                 STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS       AGE
   local-hostpath-pvc   Pending                                      openebs-hostpath   3m7s
   ```

## Create Pod to Consume OpenEBS Local PV Hostpath Storage

1. Here is the configuration file for the Pod that uses Local PV. Save the following Pod definition to `local-hostpath-pod.yaml`.

   ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: hello-local-hostpath-pod
   spec:
     volumes:
     - name: local-storage
       persistentVolumeClaim:
         claimName: local-hostpath-pvc
     containers:
     - name: hello-container
       image: busybox
       command:
          - sh
          - -c
          - 'while true; do echo "`date` [`hostname`] Hello from OpenEBS Local PV." >> /mnt/store/greet.txt; sleep $(($RANDOM % 5 + 300)); done'
       volumeMounts:
       - mountPath: /mnt/store
         name: local-storage
   ```

   :::note
   As the Local PV storage classes use `waitForFirstConsumer`, do not use `nodeName` in the Pod spec to specify node affinity. If `nodeName` is used in the Pod spec, then PVC will remain in `pending` state. See [here](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/2915) for more details.
   :::

2. Create the Pod:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f local-hostpath-pod.yaml
   ```

3. Verify that the container in the Pod is running.

   ```
   kubectl get pod hello-local-hostpath-pod
   ```
4. Verify that the data is being written to the volume.

   ```
   kubectl exec hello-local-hostpath-pod -- cat /mnt/store/greet.txt
   ```
   
5. Verify that the container is using the Local PV Hostpath.
   ```
   kubectl describe pod hello-local-hostpath-pod
   ```

   The output shows that the Pod is running on `Node: gke-user-helm-default-pool-3a63aff5-1tmf` and using the persistent volume provided by `local-hostpath-pvc`.

   ```shell hideCopy
   Name:         hello-local-hostpath-pod
   Namespace:    default
   Priority:     0
   Node:         gke-user-helm-default-pool-3a63aff5-1tmf/10.128.0.28
   Start Time:   Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:56:04 +0000  
   ...  
   Volumes:
     local-storage:
       Type:       PersistentVolumeClaim (a reference to a PersistentVolumeClaim in the same namespace)
       ClaimName:  local-hostpath-pvc
       ReadOnly:   false
   ...
   ```

6. Look at the PersistentVolumeClaim again to see the details about the dynamically provisioned Local PersistentVolume
   ```
   kubectl get pvc local-hostpath-pvc
   ```

   The output shows that the `STATUS` is `Bound`. A new Persistent Volume `pvc-864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425` has been created. 

   ```shell hideCopy
   NAME                 STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS       AGE
   local-hostpath-pvc   Bound    pvc-864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425   5G         RWO            openebs-hostpath   28m
   ```

7. Look at the PersistentVolume details to see where the data is stored. Replace the PVC name with the one that was displayed in the previous step. 
   ```
   kubectl get pv pvc-864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425 -o yaml
   ```
   The output shows that the PV was provisioned in response to PVC request  `spec.claimRef.name: local-hostpath-pvc`. 

   ```shell hideCopy
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: PersistentVolume
   metadata:
     name: pvc-864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425
     annotations:
       pv.kubernetes.io/provisioned-by: openebs.io/local
     ...
   spec:
     accessModes:
       - ReadWriteOnce
     capacity:
       storage: 5G
     claimRef:
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
       name: local-hostpath-pvc
       namespace: default
       resourceVersion: "291148"
       uid: 864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425  
     ...
     ...
     local:
       fsType: ""
       path: /var/openebs/local/pvc-864a5ac8-dd3f-416b-9f4b-ffd7d285b425
     nodeAffinity:
       required:
         nodeSelectorTerms:
         - matchExpressions:
           - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
             operator: In
             values:
             - gke-user-helm-default-pool-3a63aff5-1tmf
     persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
     storageClassName: openebs-hostpath
     volumeMode: Filesystem
   status:
     phase: Bound
   ```
   <br/>

:::note 
A few important characteristics of an *OpenEBS Local PV* can be seen from the above output: 
- `spec.nodeAffinity` specifies the Kubernetes node where the Pod using the Hostpath volume is scheduled. 
- `spec.local.path` specifies the unique subdirectory under the `BasePath (/var/local/openebs)` defined in the corresponding StorageClass.

## Deploy Stateful Workloads

The application developers will launch their application (stateful workloads) that will in turn create Persistent Volume Claims for requesting the Storage or Volumes for their pods. The Platform teams can provide templates for the applications with associated PVCs or application developers can select from the list of Storage Classes available for them. 

As an application developer, all you have to do is substitute the `StorageClass` in your PVCs with the OpenEBS Storage Classes available in your Kubernetes cluster. 

**Here are examples of some applications using OpenEBS:**

- PostgreSQL
- Percona
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Cassandra
- Prometheus
- Elastic
- MinIO

## Managing the Life Cycle of OpenEBS Components

Once the workloads are up and running, the platform or the operations team can observe the system using the cloud native tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and so forth. The operational tasks are a shared responsibility across the teams: 
* Application teams can watch out for the capacity and performance and tune the PVCs accordingly. 
* Platform or Cluster teams can check for the utilization and performance of the storage per node and decide on expansion and spreading out of the Data Engines. 
* Infrastructure team will be responsible for planning the expansion or optimizations based on the utilization of the resources.
