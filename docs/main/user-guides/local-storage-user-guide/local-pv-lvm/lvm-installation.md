This section explains the prerequisites and installation requirements to set up OpenEBS Local Persistent Volumes (PV) backed by LVM Storage.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the LVM driver, make sure your Kubernetes Cluster must meet the below prerequisite:

- All the nodes must have lvm2 utils installed and the dm-snapshot kernel module loaded.

## Setup Volume Group

Find the disk that you want to use for the LVM, for testing you can use the loopback device.

```
truncate -s 1024G /tmp/disk.img
sudo losetup -f /tmp/disk.img --show
```

Create the Volume group on all the nodes, which will be used by the LVM Driver for provisioning the volumes.

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/loop0
sudo vgcreate lvmvg /dev/loop0
```

In the above command, `lvmvg` is the volume group name to be created.

## Installation

Refer to the [OpenEBS Installation documentation](../../../quickstart-guide/installation.md) to install Local PV LVM.

## Support

If you encounter issues or have a question, file a [Github issue](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/new), or talk to us on the [#openebs channel on the Kubernetes Slack server](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/openebs/).
