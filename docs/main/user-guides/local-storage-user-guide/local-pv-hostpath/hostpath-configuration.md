# Configuration

This section will help you to configure the Local PV Hostpath.

## Create StorageClass

You can skip this section if you would like to use the default OpenEBS Local PV Hostpath StorageClass created by OpenEBS. 

The default Storage Class is called `openebs-hostpath` and its `BasePath` is configured as `/var/openebs/local`. 

1. To create your own StorageClass with custom `BasePath`, save the following StorageClass definition as `local-hostpath-sc.yaml`

   ```
   apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
   kind: StorageClass
   metadata:
     name: local-hostpath
     annotations:
       openebs.io/cas-type: local
       cas.openebs.io/config: |
         - name: StorageType
           value: hostpath
         - name: BasePath
           value: /var/local-hostpath
   provisioner: openebs.io/local
   reclaimPolicy: Delete
   volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
   ```
    ### (Optional) Custom Node Labeling

    In Kubernetes, Local PV Hostpath identifies nodes using labels such as `kubernetes.io/hostname=<node-name>`. However, these default labels might not ensure each node is distinct across the entire cluster. To solve this, you can make custom labels. As an admin, you can define and set these labels when configuring a **StorageClass**. Here's a sample storage class:

    ```
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: local-hostpath
      annotations:
        openebs.io/cas-type: local
        cas.openebs.io/config: |
          - name: StorageType
            value: "hostpath"
          - name: NodeAffinityLabels
            list:
              - "openebs.io/custom-node-unique-id"
    provisioner: openebs.io/local
    volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer

    ```
  :::note 
  Using NodeAffinityLabels does not influence the scheduling of the application Pod. Use Kubernetes [Allowed Topologies](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner/blob/develop/docs/tutorials/hostpath/allowedtopologies.md) to configure scheduling options.
  :::

2. Edit `local-hostpath-sc.yaml` and update with your desired values for `metadata.name` and `cas.openebs.io/config.BasePath`.

   :::note 
   If the `BasePath` does not exist on the node, *OpenEBS Dynamic Local PV Provisioner* will attempt to create the directory, when the first Local Volume is scheduled on to that node. You MUST ensure that the value provided for `BasePath` is a valid absolute path. 
   :::

3. Create OpenEBS Local PV Hostpath Storage Class. 
   ```
   kubectl apply -f local-hostpath-sc.yaml
   ```

4. Verify that the StorageClass is successfully created. 
   ```
   kubectl get sc local-hostpath -o yaml
   ```
