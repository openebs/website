This section explains the instructions to deploy an application for the OpenEBS Local Persistent Volumes (PV) backed by Hostpath.

Refer to the [Deploy an Application documentation](../../../quickstart-guide/installation.md) for deployment instructions.

## Cleanup

Delete the Pod, the PersistentVolumeClaim and StorageClass that you might have created. 

```
kubectl delete pod hello-local-hostpath-pod
kubectl delete pvc local-hostpath-pvc
kubectl delete sc local-hostpath
```

Verify that the PV that was dynamically created is also deleted. 
```
kubectl get pv
```
