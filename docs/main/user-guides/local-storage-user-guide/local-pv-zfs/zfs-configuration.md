# Configuration

This section will help you to configure Local PV ZFS.

## Create StorageClass

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-zfspv
parameters:
  recordsize: "128k"
  compression: "off"
  dedup: "off"
  fstype: "zfs"
  poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

The storage class contains the volume parameters like recordsize (should be power of 2), compression, dedup, and fstype. You can select what are all parameters you want. In case ZFS property parameters are not provided, the volume will inherit the properties from the ZFS Pool.

The poolname is the must argument. It should be noted that poolname can either be the root dataset or a child dataset e.g.

```
poolname: "zfspv-pool"
poolname: "zfspv-pool/child"
```

Also, the dataset provided under `poolname` must exist on all the nodes with the name given in the storage class. Check the doc on storageclasses to know all the supported parameters for Local PV ZFS.

**ext2/3/4 or xfs or btrfs as FsType**
If we provide fstype as one of ext2/3/4 or xfs or btrfs, the driver will create a ZVOL, which is a blockdevice carved out of ZFS Pool. This blockdevice will be formatted with corresponding filesystem before it's used by the driver.

:::note
There will be a filesystem layer on top of ZFS volume and applications may not get optimal performance.
:::

A sample storage class for ext4 fstype is provided below:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-zfspv
parameters:
  volblocksize: "4k"
  compression: "off"
  dedup: "off"
  fstype: "ext4"
  poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

:::note
We are providing `volblocksize` instead of `recordsize` since we will create a ZVOL, for which we can select the blocksize with which we want to create the block device. The volblocksize should be power of 2.
:::

**ZFS as FsType**

In case if we provide "zfs" as the fstype, the ZFS driver will create ZFS DATASET in the ZFS Pool, which is the ZFS filesystem. Here, there will not be any extra layer between application and storage, and applications can get the optimal performance.

The sample storage class for ZFS fstype is provided below:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-zfspv
parameters:
  recordsize: "128k"
  compression: "off"
  dedup: "off"
  fstype: "zfs"
  poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

:::note
We are providing `recordsize` which will be used to create the ZFS datasets, which specifies the maximum block size for files in the zfs file system. The recordsize has to be power of 2 for ZFS datasets.
:::

**ZPOOL Availability**

If ZFS pool is available on certain nodes only, then make use of topology to tell the list of nodes where we have the ZFS pool available. As shown in the below storage class, we can use allowedTopologies to use the ZFS pools only from the specified nodes.

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  recordsize: "128k"
  compression: "off"
  dedup: "off"
  fstype: "zfs"
  poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
allowedTopologies:
- matchLabelExpressions:
  - key: kubernetes.io/hostname
    values:
      - zfspv-node1
      - zfspv-node2
```

The above storage class tells that ZFS pool "zfspv-pool" is available on nodes zfspv-node1 and zfspv-node2 only. The ZFS driver will create volumes on those nodes only.

:::note
The provisioner name for ZFS driver is "zfs.csi.openebs.io", we have to use this while creating the storage class so that the volume provisioning/deprovisioning request can come to ZFS driver.
:::

**Scheduler**

The ZFS driver has its own scheduler which will try to distribute the PV across the nodes so that one node should not be loaded with all the volumes. Currently the driver supports two scheduling algorithms: VolumeWeighted and CapacityWeighted, in which it will try to find a ZFS pool which has less number of volumes provisioned in it or less capacity of volume provisioned out of a pool respectively, from all the nodes where the ZFS pools are available. See [here](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/blob/HEAD/docs/storageclasses.md#storageclass-with-k8s-scheduler) to know about how to select scheduler via storage-class.

Once it can find the node, it will create a PV for that node and also create a ZFSVolume custom resource for the volume with the NODE information. The watcher for this ZFSVolume CR will get all the information for this object and creates a ZFS dataset (zvol) with the given ZFS property on the mentioned node.

The scheduling algorithm currently only accounts for either the number of ZFS volumes or total capacity occupied from a zpool and does not account for other factors like available cpu or memory while making scheduling decisions.

So if you want to use node selector/affinity rules on the application pod, or have cpu/memory constraints, Kubernetes scheduler should be used. To make use of Kubernetes scheduler, you can set the `volumeBindingMode` as `WaitForFirstConsumer` in the storage class.

This will cause a delayed binding, i.e. Kubernetes scheduler will schedule the application pod first and then it will ask the ZFS driver to create the PV.

The driver will then create the PV on the node where the pod is scheduled:

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  recordsize: "128k"
  compression: "off"
  dedup: "off"
  fstype: "zfs"
  poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

:::note
Once a PV is created for a node, application using that PV will always get scheduled to that particular node only, as PV will be sticky to that node.
:::

The scheduling algorithm by ZFS driver or Kubernetes will come into picture only during the deployment time. Once the PV is created, the application can not move anywhere as the data is there on the node where the PV is.

## Create PersistentVolumeClaim

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: csi-zfspv
spec:
  storageClassName: openebs-zfspv
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
```

Create a PVC using the storage class created for the ZFS driver. Here, the allocated volume size will be rounded off to the nearest Mi or Gi notation, see [FAQs](../../../faqs/faqs.md) for more details.

If we are using the immediate binding in the storageclass then we can check the Kubernetes resource for the corresponding ZFS volume, otherwise in late binding case, we can check the same after pod has been scheduled:

```
$ kubectl get zv -n openebs
NAME                                       ZPOOL        NODE           SIZE         STATUS   FILESYSTEM   AGE

The ZFS driver will create a ZFS dataset (or zvol as per fstype in the storageclass) on the node zfspv-node1 for the mentioned ZFS pool and the dataset name will same as PV name.

Go to the node zfspv-node1 and check the volume:

```
$ zfs list

```

## Parameters

### Poolname (Must Parameter)

poolname specifies the name of the pool where the volume has been created. The *poolname* is the must argument. It should be noted that *poolname* can either be the root dataset or a child dataset e.g.
```
poolname: "zfspv-pool"
poolname: "zfspv-pool/child"
```
Also, the dataset provided under `poolname` must exist on *all the nodes* with the name given in the storage class.

### FSType (Optional Parameter)

FsType specifies filesystem type for the zfs volume/dataset. If FsType is provided as "zfs", then the driver will create a ZFS dataset, formatting is
not required as underlying filesystem is ZFS anyway. If FsType is ext2, ext3, ext4 btrfs or xfs, then the driver will create a ZVOL and format the volume
accordingly. FsType can not be modified once volume has been provisioned. If fstype is not provided, k8s takes ext4 as the default fstype.

allowed values: "zfs", "ext2", "ext3", "ext4", "xfs", "btrfs"

### Recordsize (Optional Parameter)

This parameter is applicable if fstype provided is "zfs" otherwise it will be ignored. It specifies a suggested block size for files in the file system.

allowed values: Any power of 2 from 512 bytes to 128 Kbytes

### Volblocksize (Optional Parameter)

This parameter is applicable if fstype is anything but "zfs" where we create a ZVOL a raw block device carved out of ZFS Pool. It specifies the block size to use for the zvol. The volume size can only be set to a multiple of volblocksize, and cannot be zero.

allowed values: Any power of 2 from 512 bytes to 128 Kbytes

### Compression (Optional Parameter)

Compression specifies the block-level compression algorithm to be applied to the ZFS Volume and datasets. The value "on" indicates ZFS to use the default compression algorithm.

allowed values: "on", "off", "lzjb", "zstd", "zstd-1", "zstd-2", "zstd-3", "zstd-4", "zstd-5", "zstd-6", "zstd-7", "zstd-8", "zstd-9", "zstd-10", "zstd-11", "zstd-12", "zstd-13", "zstd-14", "zstd-15", "zstd-16", "zstd-17", "zstd-18", "zstd-19", "gzip", "gzip-1", "gzip-2", "gzip-3", "gzip-4", "gzip-5", "gzip-6", "gzip-7", "gzip-8", "gzip-9", "zle", "lz4"

### Dedup (Optional Parameter)

Deduplication is the process for removing redundant data at the block level, reducing the total amount of data stored.

allowed values: "on", "off"

### Thinprovision (Optional Parameter)

ThinProvision describes whether space reservation for the source volume is required or not. The value "yes" indicates that volume should be thin provisioned and "no" means thick provisioning of the volume. If thinProvision is set to "yes" then volume can be provisioned even if the ZPOOL does not have enough capacity. If thinProvision is set to "no" then volume can be provisioned only if the ZPOOL has enough capacity and capacity required by volume can be reserved. Omitting this parameter lets ZFS default behavior prevail: `thin` provisioning for filesystems and `thick` provisioning (through refreservation) for volumes.

allowed values: "yes", "no"

### Shared (Optional Parameter)

Shared specifies whether the volume can be shared among multiple pods. If it is not set to "yes", then the ZFS-LocalPV Driver will not allow the volumes to be mounted by more than one pods. The default value is "no" if shared is not provided in the storageclass.

allowed values: "yes", "no"

## Usage

Let us look at few storageclasses.

### StorageClass Backed by ZFS Dataset

We can create a StorageClass with the fstype as “zfs”. Here, the ZFS-LocalPV driver will create a ZFS dataset for the persistence storage. The application will get a dataset for the storage operation. We can also provide recordsize, compression, or dedup property in the StorageClass. The dataset will be created with all the properties mentioned in the StorageClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 recordsize: "128k"
 thinprovision: "no"
 fstype: "zfs"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

We have the thinprovision option as “no” in the StorageClass, which means that do reserve the space for all the volumes provisioned using this StorageClass. We can set it to “yes” if we do not want to reserve the space for the provisioned volumes.

The allowVolumeExpansion is needed if we want to resize the volumes provisioned by the StorageClass. ZFS-LocalPV supports online volume resize, which means we don’t need to scale down the application. The new size will be visible to the application automatically.

Once the storageClass is created, we can go ahead and create the PVC and deploy a pod using that PVC.

### StorageClass Backed by ZFS Volume

There are a few applications that need to have different filesystems to work optimally. For example, Concourse performs best using the [“btrfs” filesystem](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/issues/169). Here we can create a StorageClass with the desired fstype we want. The ZFS-LocalPV driver will create a ZVOL, which is a raw block device carved out from the mentioned ZPOOL and format it to the desired filesystem for the applications to use as persistence storage backed by ZFS Storage Pool:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: opeenbs-zfspv
parameters:
 volblocksize: "4k"
 thinprovision: "yes"
 fstype: "btrfs"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

Here, we can mention any fstype we want. As of 0.9 release, the driver supports ext2/3/4, xfs, and btrfs fstypes for which it will create a ZFS Volume. Please note here, if fstype is not provided in the StorageClass, the k8s takes “ext4" as the default fstype. Here also we can provide volblocksize, compression, and dedup properties to create the volume, and the driver will create the volume with all the properties provided in the StorageClass.

We have the thinprovision option as “yes” in the StorageClass, which means that it does not reserve the space for all the volumes provisioned using this StorageClass. We can set it to “no” if we want to reserve the space for the provisioned volumes.

### StorageClass for Sharing the Persistence Volumes

By default, the ZFS-LocalPV driver does not allow Volumes to be mounted by more than one pod. Even if we try to do that, only one Pod will come into the running state, and the other Pod will be in ContainerCreating state, and it will be failing on the mount.

If we want to share a volume among multiple pods, we can create a StorageClass with the “shared” option as “yes”. For this, we can create a StorageClass backed by ZFS dataset as below:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 fstype: "zfs"
 shared: "yes"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

Or, we can create the StorageClass backed by ZFS Volume for sharing it among multiple pods as below:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 fstype: "ext4"
 shared: "yes"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
```

Here, we have to note that all the Pods using that volume will come to the same node as the data is available on that particular node only. Also, applications need to be aware that the volume is shared by multiple pods and should synchronize with the other Pods to access the data from the volume.

### StorageClass with k8s Scheduler

The ZFS-LocalPV Driver has two types of its own scheduling logic, VolumeWeighted and CapacityWeighted (Supported from zfs-driver: 1.3.0+). To choose any one of the scheduler add scheduler parameter in storage class and give its value accordingly.
```
parameters:
 scheduler: "VolumeWeighted"
 fstype: "zfs"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
```
CapacityWeighted is the default scheduler in zfs-localpv driver, so even if we don't use scheduler parameter in storage-class, driver will pick the node where total provisioned volumes have occupied less capacity from the given pool. On the other hand for using VolumeWeighted scheduler, we have to specify it under scheduler parameter in storage-class. Then driver will pick the node to create volume where ZFS Pool is less loaded with the volumes. Here, it just checks the volume count and creates the volume where less volume is configured in a given ZFS Pool. It does not account for other factors like available CPU or memory while making scheduling decisions.

In case where you want to use node selector/affinity rules on the application pod or have CPU/Memory constraints, the Kubernetes scheduler should be used. To make use of Kubernetes scheduler, we can set the volumeBindingMode as WaitForFirstConsumer in the storage class:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: openebs-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 fstype: "zfs"
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

Here, in this case, the Kubernetes scheduler will select a node for the POD and then ask the ZFS-LocalPV driver to create the volume on the selected node. The driver will create the volume where the POD has been scheduled.

From zfs-driver version 1.6.0+, pvc will not be bound till the provisioner succesfully creates the volume on node. Previously, pvc gets bound even if zfs volume creation on nodes keeps failing because scheduler used to return only a single node and provisioner keeps trying to provision the volume on that node only. Now onwards scheduler will return the list of nodes that satisfies the provided topology constraints. Then csi controller will continuosly attempt the volume creation on all these nodes and till volume is created on any of the node or volume creation gets failed on all the nodes. PVC will be bound to a PV only if volume creation succeeds on any one of the nodes.

### StorageClass with Custom Node Labels

There can be a use case where we have certain kinds of ZFS Pool present on certain nodes only, and we want a particular type of application to use that ZFS Pool. We can create a storage class with `allowedTopologies` and mention all the nodes there where that pool is present:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: nvme-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
allowedTopologies:
- matchLabelExpressions:
 - key: openebs.io/nodename
   values:
     - node-1
     - node-2
```

At the same time, you must set env variables in the ZFS-LocalPV CSI driver daemon sets (openebs-zfs-node) so that it can pick the node label as the supported topology. It adds "openebs.io/nodename" as default topology key. If the key does not exist in the node labels when the CSI ZFS driver register, the key will not add to the topologyKeys. Set more than one keys separated by commas.

```yaml
env:
  - name: OPENEBS_NODE_NAME
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: spec.nodeName
  - name: OPENEBS_CSI_ENDPOINT
    value: unix:///plugin/csi.sock
  - name: OPENEBS_NODE_DRIVER
    value: agent
  - name: OPENEBS_NAMESPACE
    value: openebs
  - name: ALLOWED_TOPOLOGIES
    value: "test1,test2"
```

We can verify that key has been registered successfully with the ZFS LocalPV CSI Driver by checking the CSI node object yaml:

```yaml
$ kubectl get csinodes pawan-node-1 -oyaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: CSINode
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2020-04-13T14:49:59Z"
  name: k8s-node-1
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Node
    name: k8s-node-1
    uid: fe268f4b-d9a9-490a-a999-8cde20c4dadb
  resourceVersion: "4586341"
  selfLink: /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/csinodes/k8s-node-1
  uid: 522c2110-9d75-4bca-9879-098eb8b44e5d
spec:
  drivers:
  - name: zfs.csi.openebs.io
    nodeID: k8s-node-1
    topologyKeys:
    - openebs.io/nodename
    - test1
    - test2
```

If you want to change topology keys, just set new env(ALLOWED_TOPOLOGIES). See [FAQs](../../../faqs/faqs.md#how-to-add-custom-topology-key-to-local-pv-zfs-driver) for more details.

```
$ kubectl edit ds -n kube-system openebs-zfs-node
```

Here we can have ZFS Pool of name “zfspv-pool” created on the nvme disks and want to use this high performing ZFS Pool for the applications that need higher IOPS. We can use the above SorageClass to create the PVC and deploy the application using that.

The ZFS-LocalPV driver will create the Volume in the Pool “zfspv-pool” present on the node  which will be seleted based on scheduler we chose in storage-class. In the above StorageClass, if total capacity of provisioned volumes on node-1 is less, it will create the volume on node-1 only. Alternatively, we can use `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` to let the k8s select the node where the volume should be provisioned.

The problem with the above StorageClass is that it works fine if the number of nodes is less, but if the number of nodes is huge, it is cumbersome to list all the nodes like this. In that case, what we can do is, we can label all the similar nodes using the same key value and use that label to create the StorageClass.

```
pawan@pawan-master:~/pawan$ kubectl label node pawan-node-2 openebs.io/zpool=nvme
node/pawan-node-2 labeled
pawan@pawan-master:~/pawan$ kubectl label node pawan-node-1 openebs.io/zpool=nvme
node/pawan-node-1 labeled
```

Add "openebs.io/zpool" to the ZFS-LocalPV CSI driver daemon sets env(ALLOWED_TOPOLOGIES). Now, we can create the StorageClass like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 name: nvme-zfspv
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
 poolname: "zfspv-pool"
provisioner: zfs.csi.openebs.io
allowedTopologies:
- matchLabelExpressions:
 - key: openebs.io/zpool
   values:
     - nvme
```

Here, the volumes will be provisioned on the nodes which has label “openebs.io/zpool” set as “nvme”.

## Conclusion

We can set up different kinds of StorageClasses as per our need, and then we can proceed with PVC and POD creation. The driver will take the care of honoring the requests put in the PVC and the StorageClass.
