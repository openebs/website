description: This guide explains about the eventing feature.

The event bus facilitates the transmission of events to subscribers using a NATS-based system. When eventing is enabled, NATS pods are created to gather various events from the cluster. These events are generated by changes in the system, such as the creation and deletion of volumes and replicas. 

Presently, callhome serves as the sole consumer for these events. Within the obs-callhome-stats container, the stats exporter operates by listening on the event bus for events. It collects these events and makes them available as part of callhome metrics.
